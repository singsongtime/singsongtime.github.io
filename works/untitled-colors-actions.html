        “<i>...the performers look lonely...</br>”
        <br><br>
           Fundamentally, this piece is a meditation on the meeting of two forces. There is, on one hand, an attempt to transcode musical logic, to stage the arrival of meaning by the strategic mixing of codes; It asks, for example, what new meaning might something like gesture offer if its internal relations were determined by a musical logic? The other force at play is the entertainment of an intensive arbitrariness, which tends to cancel meaningful realtions generated through the former process; the arbitrariness casts the relations as blank coincidence. The result of the collision is perhaps the impression of boredom.
        <br><br>
        At this point, we may give an illustration of the techniques of the above forces.
         <br><br>
           The primary source material that we begin with is the well-known melody of the <i>Dies irae</i>. To begin the process of transcoding, we interpret our source material -- the melody of the <i>Dies irae</i> -- as a code. The melody read as a code happens to yield a set of relations between pitches. We then transcode these pitch-relations onto the space of color and of gesture (for the sake of simplicity, I'm omitting the interesting fact that the pitch-relations are additionally mapped back onto musical space, onto a two unique systems of sonic relations). Here is where things get strange. Now, we've arrived a set of colors and of gestures whose internal relationships are determined by the logic of a melody.
        <br><br>
          The force of aleatory operates here like a mise en scene. Each of the five performers, seated at a table in the darkness, happens to have a laptop computer in front of them. The performers stare into the screen, which, in return, illuminates their upper bodies with a color that, in turn, makes them visible to the audience. Here is a key: the rhythm of the changing colors happens to be determined by an aleatoric algorithm, which is unsynchronized across the performers. The onsets of gestures and sounds are cued by the colors, with which they share a one-to-one correspondence. We are left with a cloud of arbitrary counterpoint: colors, sounds, and rhythms, regularly irregular, shield the performance from intelligibility.
         <br><br>
           To begin to put these ideas together, we could ask: what is the puzzle here? What does <i>untitled 2018</i> represent? While there is indeed an attempt here to invent new meaning by mixing codes, we’re unsynchronized, the system becomes clouded. The fact that we are unsynchronized is by design: our movements are determined an algorithm, which we strictly follow. The algorithm operates to enforce the inaccessibility of any meaning we could gain from the invention of new forms.
