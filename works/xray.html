        In XRAY, found video representing dream content is projected and mapped onto a transportable, white organ from one point in the room, while a dimly lit organist plays to match the narrative. The piece unfolds sequentially in three episodes, each around three minutes in duration, disjointed by abrupt changes from one to the next. The first drudges upwards, wandering past lichen-covered earth, monochrome images of war, hikers, thunder, accompanied by morse code spelling “S.T.O.R.M.”. 
            Each of the organ's faces are discrete. From behind the audience, a musician approaches the organ to prepare it for the second episode. In the second episode, the whole organ is a single screen across which a Playboy ballerina turns in slow motion from one end to the other. The organist dully repeats a fairground-style section of a Soviet march. The third and final episode spills showering layers of loud, asynchronized, descending scales, repeating themselves, growing broader over time as the two grand pianos in the room, having waited silently up to this point, join in. 
            Projected on the organ itself, simultaneously a whole surface and an aggregate of smaller, discrete screens, is a polyphony of deer caught on night-vision video between trees, walking and feeding.
